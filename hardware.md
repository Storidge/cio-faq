# Hardware

### Is there a hardware compatibility list?

There is no compatibility list. However there are minimum resource recommendation listed [here](https://docs.storidge.com/prerequisites/hardware.html). 

### Does Storidge come as a hardware appliance?

Storidge is delivered as software only. However we do work with hardware vendors for users who prefer an integrated appliance.

### Should nodes in a cluster be configured exactly the same?

No. Nodes in a cluster can have different configurations of drives and drive type. Storidge will automatically discover and group drives accordingly. 

However, it is recommended to have balanced capacity across nodes to maximize capacity usage and minimize recovery time when a node fails.
