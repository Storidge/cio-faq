# License

### Will there always be a "community" (free) edition? Or do I get presented with a license fee later?

Yes, there will always be a Community Edition (free). Note that the free edition is up to 5 nodes and 10 TBs of capacity.

The generous limits are there so the Community Edition can be deployed for serious work.

### What are limits of the Community Edition (CE)?

The Community Edition is free forever. It does have a limit of up to 5 Storidge nodes in a Swarm or Kubernetes cluster. The storage capacity in the cluster is limited to 10 TBs.
