# License

### Will there always be a "community" (free) edition? Or do I get presented with a license fee later?

Yes, there will always be a Community Edition (free). Note that the free edition is up to 5 nodes and 10 TBs of capacity.

The generous limits are there so the Community Edition can be deployed for serious work.

### What are limits of the Community Edition (CE)?

The Community Edition is free forever. It does have a limit of up to 5 Storidge nodes in a Swarm or Kubernetes cluster. The storage capacity in the cluster is limited to 10 TBs.

### What are my payment options - credit card and/or invoicing?

You can use your credit card to pay for any plan. If you sign up for an Annual subscription, we can invoice you annually. Please connect with us for more information.

### We want to cancel a subscription. How do we do that?

You can change the monthly subscription plan at any time. Since the subscription is charged by hourly usage during each month, there will not be any remaining balance that needs to be refunded.

For annual pre-paid subscriptions, you get credit back for the unused portion of the subscription. This credit can be utilized on a new cluster.

### Do you offer discounts for non-profits or educational institutions?

Storidge wants to support people in the world who are doing great things. Thatâ€™s why we offer special pricing for qualified nonprofit organizations and educational institutions. Please connect with us. 

### We want to integrate Storidge as part of a solution. Do you have programs and discounts for system integrators or DevOps consultants?

Storidge is designed for easy integration into your software stack. We love to partner with you and deliver joint solutions. Please contact us to start a conversation.
